# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project was to design a webpage that would search a javascript webpage and deliver results on all UFO experiences. This list of data was also designed to be filtered by user input.
## Results
The webpage contains the ability to filter results by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape of UFO sighting and produces details on comments.

## Summary
This allows a user to find good comments to pull from if they know the syntax. Some of the ways that this could limiting is that you may want to search for comments alone to find the most sightings. To resolve this drawback, another filter or search criteria could be designed to pull in any "like..." strings of words to pull into all comments regardless of the other filters.
